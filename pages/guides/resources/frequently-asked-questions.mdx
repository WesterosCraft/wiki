# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is WesterosCraft?

Our mission is to recreate the universe imagined by author [George RR Martin](http://www.georgerrmartin.com/) in his book series [A Song of Ice and Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) (ASoIaF) as accurately and precisely as possible within the confines of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), in an effort to custom create a world which will be the stage for a [roleplaying game](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/forum/mmo.44/).** In pursuit of this endeavor we aim to provide a friendly and encouraging atmosphere for our creative community at all times.**

To accomplish this we use our [Forums](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/forum/) , this [Wiki ](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki), a [Dynamic Map](http://mc.westeroscraft.com/) , [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) , a [Custom Launcher](http://www.westeroscraft.com/launcher) , and the [Song of Ice and Fire books](http://www.amazon.com/George-Martins-Thrones-5-Book-Boxed/dp/0345535529/ref=la_B000APIGH4_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1391856345&sr=1-1) in addition to hundreds of online resources that we use to learn as much as possible about the world we are building.

Most importantly, we are a community of people dedicated to both our loves for Minecraft and the ASoIaF series, and use this project as a way to explore our relevant interests.

### What is a custom launcher and why do you have one?

Over the years we found that we were slowly pushing the limits of what a traditional Minecraft game could handle, and decided we needed to develop our own launcher in order to handle our constantly growing needs. A launcher is a program designed to 'launch' an application, such as Minecraft. As long as you have a legal copy of the Minecraft game, you should be able to use our launcher without issue. You can purchase a digital copy of Minecraft [here](https://minecraft.net/) . The launcher enables us to expand our inventory of custom blocks, provide everyone with easy-access to our custom texture pack, and to be able to implement roleplaying elements into the game which could otherwise not exist. You can easily download our launcher [**here**.](http://www.westeroscraft.com/launcher)

### I am having difficulty logging into the server, what can I do?

Head over to our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/guides/troubleshooting-guide). It answers the most frequent issues users had in the past, and is likely to contain the answer to your problem as well. If your problem persists you may contact us via the [Support Forum](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/forum/support.40/) or on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pBS5TH4). Please note that requests not following the [Submission Rules](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/threads/electron-launcher-tech-support-read-before-you-post.1511/) will be deleted.

### When can I roleplay on the map?

We're working on this project since late 2011. So far, we've done and redone our map a couple of times, at present we are roughly at 60% completion. We can not make a reliable prediction about when we would be able to finish this, but we're getting closer with every house and every castle that's built.

Here is a link to our list of[**WesterosCraft Projects**](https://www.westeroscraft.com/progress) .

### Can I download the map?

Unfortunately the map is not available for download. One reason would be the large file size of the map, another is the project isn't completed, and another is that the map is and always will be free to visit.

### Are you going to build Essos? (Qarth, Astapor, Braavos, etc)

While the immediate goal is to finish Westeros, there is a great deal of interest in Essos and its creation. It is more than likely we will create all of Essos, but it will still be quite some time before we get there.

### What are the ranks of the server?

- Nobuild: Exactly what it means, these members and visitors do not have any permissions to alter our map. This is the default starting rank.
- NewBuilder, [N]-Builder: Also called Probation Builder, or Probie. They have permissions to build, but are required to meet certain requirements. An experienced builder assists them during their first weeks of buildership.
- Builder: The server's workforce. They create most of the content by hand.
- Builders with Editor Lite, [E]-Lites: Builders can apply for limited WorldEdit perms to use for terraforming heavy operations at their own projects.
- Editors: These are builders with permissions for WorldEdit and VoxelSniper. They handle minor worldediting requests as well as large terraformings
- Moderators: Handle the administration of the server. They reply to builder applications, organise and moderate content creation, serve justice and officially represent the community.
- Coders: The technical backbone of the server, they maintain the complex workings 'behind the scenes'
- Administrators: The founders and captains of the server, they are in control of the finances and hardware.

### How do I become a Builder?

Read the [Application Guidelines](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/form/builder-application.3/select) carefully, they are very important. Then fill out the application form completely.

As a word of advice, be sure to explore our server thoroughly before submitting your application so that you know what kinds of builds we are looking for. If you do not submit any images of builds, your application will be rejected. Check out our [Basic Building Guide for Applicants](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/guides/applicant-building-guide) for more helpful advice.

## Gameplay

### What can I do on the server?

If you are a new visitor, you are free to explore the server and it's builds at your leisure. Please check our [Server Rules](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/miscellaneous/server-rules) before going online.

Unfortunately you will not be able to build until you have put in an [application on our forums](https://forum.westeroscraft.com/form/builder-application.3/select) and been accepted. For more info about this, check out our [Basic Building Guide for Applicants](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/guides/applicant-building-guide) before making an application.

### How do I visit a location?

If you know the name of the place you want to visit, type **/warp [location]** in the chat. Replace [location] with the name of your destination. Warp names are one word only with no punctuation. For example, to warp to King's Landing type **/warp kingslanding** in chat. If you don't know the name or you are unsure about the spelling you are welcome to ask.

A great way to explore new locations is** /warp map** in game

To see all of our warps in one place, or just to check out the scale of our map, check out our [**dynamic map**](http://mc.westeroscraft.com/) . You can focus it on your character to follow your journey through Westeros, as well as enable and disable different layers of information, such as player names or warps (this can be useful to find out where you are - but beware, there is a lot of warps! Enabling this layer while zoomed out may cause your browser to freeze or crash.)

## The World

### How big is the map?

The map is currently several dozen gigs in file size. If you're wondering about the dimensions, it's roughly 22,000 x 59,000 blocks. About 1298 sq km / 501.14 sq mi, roughly the size of Los Angeles.

### How did you make the map?

We used a program called [WorldPainter](http://worldpainter.net/) to shape the map and do basic terraforming. In-game we use a mixture of hand work, [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) and [VoxelSniper](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/voxelsniper-rebooted) to refine the terrain further.

### How many people have worked on the server?

Since the beginning, we've had hundreds of contributors, but people come and go. For scale, 173 people built houses in the city of [King's Landing](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/crownlands/kings-landing). We currently have 160 active builders.

### What cities are currently finished?

You can check out all our projects by visiting our [**livemap**](http://mc.westeroscraft.com/) or our [**progress page**](https://westeroscraft.com/progress). We have quite a lot of the most famous landmarks done though, including [Winterfell](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/north/winterfell), [Castle Black](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/the-wall/castle-black), [The Wall](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/the-wall) and [King's Landing](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/crownlands/kings-landing).

### Is the server based on the books or the HBO show?

Our builds are based on the books, but we do use the HBO show as inspiration.

### What book is the the server set in?

The server is set on 3/3/299 according to this[ timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsY3lcDDtTdBWp1Gx6mfkdtZT6-Gk0kdTGeSC_Dj7WM/edit#gid=8). This puts us at the start of A Clash of Kings, specifically the first Davos chapter. Explore with caution, Westeroscraft has destinations that contain show spoilers.
