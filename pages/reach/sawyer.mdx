There is no canon location for House Sawyer, but [Ser Harry Sawyer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harry_Sawyer) is known to have been at Highgarden, so it is considered to be a House of the Reach.  
House Sawyer is canonically insignificant enough that it could be absorbed by a larger project.
