**Woodswatch-by-the-Pool** is one of the nineteen castles along [The Wall](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/the-wall) belonging to the Night's Watch. Long abandoned, it is now naught but ruins. Its name derives from the small pond on its southern side. It lies between [Sable Hall](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/the-wall/sable-hall), to the east, and [Oakenshield](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/the-wall/oakenshield), to the west.

### Features

* **Castle: **It is in huge disrepair. Most buildings have either collapsed or missing parts of their roof.
* **Weirwood tree:** A weirwood tree with a rather small trunk is located in one of the former buildings.
* **Collapsed tunnel:** As it is the case with most castles of the Night's Watch, the tunnel that used to pass through the Wall has now been sealed.
* **Stairway:** A ruined stairway can be observed leading all the way up to the top of the Wall.
* **Underground tunnels:** Underground passages used to link the buildings between them, useful especially during harsh winter times. Sleeping areas and prison cells are also located underneath the ground in those tunnels.
