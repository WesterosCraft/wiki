**House Thorne** is a noble house from The Crownlands. According to semi-canon sources, they blazon their shields with a silver flail on red within a black border rayonne. Ser Rickard Thorne was a knight of the Kingsguard during the reign of Viserys I Targaryen. Ser Alliser Thorne was on the battlements of King's Landing when Tywin Lannister sacked the city during Robert's Rebellion. Instead of execution, he chose to join the Night's Watch.

### **Features**

* Castle - The seat of House Thorne. A small norman-style square keep typical of the Crownlands. Contains a feast hall, maesters tower and lodging for the nobles of House Thorne.
* The Limber Pony - A small inn and tavern serving travelers going through the Thorne lands. Located in the town.
* Sept - A rustic sept for the Seven worshipping citzens of the town.

### **Construction**

Construction of the project began in Febuary of 2015. The Castle and town were finished within a month. The fields surrounding the town took far longer and the project was eventually completed in May.

### **Inspiration**

The build was inspired by Norman-style keeps such as Rochester Castle and Newcastle Castle.
