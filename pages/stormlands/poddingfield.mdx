**House Peasebury** is a noble house from The Stormlands. They live in a castle called **Poddingfield**, which can be found in the Dornish Marches, at the border of the Stormlands and The Reach, northeast of Harvest Hall. Their sigil shows a pea pod burst open, green on white, bordered by three rows of green peas, which is a reference to the pease fields surrounding the castle. The castle guards a mountainpass that gives acess to the Stormlands.  


### Features

* **Castle,** located on the foothills of the Dornish Marches. It is surrounded by fields and small farming hamlets. The walls are brown, which is a common feature in the Dornish Marches.
