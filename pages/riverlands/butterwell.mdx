The [God's Eye Town](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gods_Eye_town) and a variety of other landmarks which Arya comes across on her route north with Yoren are included within the remaining lands of House Butterwell. The former seat of House Butterwell, Whitewalls is now within the lands around Harrenhal and so is not included with this project.
