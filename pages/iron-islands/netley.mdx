**House Netley** is a minor house on The Iron Islands. Although its location is not mentioned, the house was placed on Orkmont . For this reason, the house is considered poor and insignificant.

### Features

* **Netley Tower,** a small tower house sits above a modest group of turf houses and docks. This tower was built from the wealth of a successful raid by House Netley, our fictitious backstory.
* **Dagon's Feast,** a longship anchored in deeper water.

### Construction

House Netley was built in Adlern in Fall 2013.

### Inspiration

House Netley's keep was inspired by Blarney Castle in Ireland.
