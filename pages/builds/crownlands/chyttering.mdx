**Chyttering** is the seat of **House Chyttering**, located in the eastern Crownlands on a peninsula known as the Massey's Hook. They blazon their shields with three golden bendlets on white, their motto is unkown.

### Features

- **Chyttering Castle,** a twin grey keep sitting upon a mountain slope with a nice view on the port village below. It is a rather small castle with four baileys, a curtain wall, keeps, tower, great hall, and more.
- **Chyttering Port,** a large village located in a small bay below the castle. The town is mainly based on fishing and agriculture from the nearby fields and pastures. The main highlight of the town is its sept and marina. The docks host a cog belonging to House Chyttering.
- **Chyttering Holdfast,** a small keep overlooking the only path leading to Chyttering lands and a small village nearby. (/warp chyhf1)
