**House Goodbrother of Downdelving** is a cadet branch of the Goodbrothers on western shores of Great Wyk. Very little is known about this branch of the large Goodbrother family.

### Features

- **Downdelving Tower,** a small square keep made of stone sits above the small village.
- **Village,** seven small hovels a crowded near a beach where their fishing boats are pulled ashore
- **Mine,** on the road to Sealskin Point is a small tin mine. Perhaps the name Downdelving is related to their modest mining background, which is a major source of income for House Goodbrother in general.

### Construction

Downdelving was constructed by Phozar in December 2013. Bluecichlid submitted a very similar application earlier, but Phozar's planned was approved and completed.

### Inspiration

The small square tower was inspired by various images of tower houses.
