**House Shepherd** is a minor house of The Iron Islands. Although their location is unknown, we have placed it on the northern tip of Great Wyk. It is considered a young house.

### Features

- **Shepherd Keep,** a small keep with two entrances.
- **Pastures,** stone fences surround multiple pastures near the keep and the village.

### Construction

BimJeam4 completed House Shepherd in November 2013.

### Inspiration

House Shepherd was inspired by the existing House Farwynd of Lonely Light, which was built by ThamusKnoward and also the layout of Flint's Finger, a northern house on Cape Kraken.
