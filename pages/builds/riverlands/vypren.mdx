**House Vypren** is a noble house of the Riverlands. The location of the house is not mentioned in the books but it has been placed in between the Green and Blue Forks of the Trident near Fairmarket. According to semi-canon sources, they blazon their arms with a black toad on white lily pad, on green. The Vypren's are descended from the Andal warlord Vorian Vypren who slayed the Darrys at the Widow's Ford.

### Features

- **Vypren Castle,** sitting on a small island on the left bank of the Green Fork, resembling the frog sitting on the lily on their arms.
- **Brickworks,** Vypren thrives off the clay mining and brick making industries.
- **Forest,** the Vypren lands are situated around a dense boggy forest.
- **Ruined Keep,** an old keep of House Vypren is situated in the center of the forest but had to be abandoned after gradually sinking into the boggy landscape.
