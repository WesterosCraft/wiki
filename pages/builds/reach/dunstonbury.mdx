Originally a castle of House Manderly, and then House Peake, who were subsequently stripped of it during the [First Blackfyre Rebellion](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dunstonbury). Who it was granted to is unknown, but it was likely to a Loyalist. [House Rodden](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Rodden) would be a suitable option.
