**House Yew** is a knightly house from The Westerlands. Their seat is a small towerhouse located on the side of a mountain, called Bowman’s Hill and is located in a valley slightly south of the Goldroad. They are known for their bow making workshops, this is also depicted on their sigil, which is a golden longbow on white between two crimson flaunches. Another reference to their bow workshops is their name, Yew, a tree from which the wood is often used for making bows.
