- Their words are “Come try me”.
- Lord Ossifer Plumm married Princess Elaena Targaryen in 176 AC, during the reign of King Aegon IV Targaryen. But rumour has it he died before he could consummate the marriage. Yet somehow the Princess Elaena was with child, and it was believed that the father was King Aegon IV Targaryen. Leading to the saying that Lord Ossifer had a “cock six foot long”.
