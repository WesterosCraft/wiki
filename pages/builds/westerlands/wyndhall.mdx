**House Estren** is a noble house from the [Westerlands](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/westerlands) located along the Tumblestone river. The only known member is Lord Regenard Estren, who is captured at the battle of The Wispering Wood.

### Features

The castle (_/warp wyndhall_) sits atop the mountain over looking the forest and the village (_/warp whvillage_) beyond. The agricultural centre of their lands is located near the southern river, centered around the hamlet (_/warp whham_). On the border with [Payne](https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/westerlands/payne-hall) lands is a holdfast (_/warp whhf_) to warn and protect against riverland invasions. Right in the middle you can find a rock formation which is the site of a gold mine (_/warp pendrichills_).
